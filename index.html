  I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://cse.iith.ac.in/">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>, IIT Hyderabad, working on 
  Optimal Transport & Explainable Machine Learning. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~saketha/">Dr Saketha Nath Jagarlapudi</a> & co-advised by 
  <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/">Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian</a> as a member of <a href="https://lab1055.github.io/">Lab1055</a>.
  <br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;I joined IIT-H in Fall '18 as an MTech Research Assistant under Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian & converted to PhD in Fall '20. My Master's research was on 
  Explainable Machine Learning with a focus on formulating attribution algorithms for neural networks. 
  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before joining IIT-H, I was an undergraduate student
  in the <a href="http://nituk.ac.in/cse/">Department of CSE</a>, NIT Uttarakhand(2014-2018). Link to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16FUqcUM0jN8sgMYpu7K-IuEliI4dMazU/view?usp=sharing">CV</a>.
