- ### Optimal Transport
  Started working on Statistical Optimal Transport with a focus on Unbalanced Optimal Transport.

- ### Attribution Algorithms for Neural Networks
  In order to leverage the power of Machine Learning(ML) in safety-critical domains, we need our ML models to be able to explain their decisions. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are one of the most successful ML models but they mostly appear as black-boxes. Attribution problem aims at making DNN's decisions transparent by assigning attribution scores to the input features, that represent their contribution towards the output.<br>
