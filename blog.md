title: My discoveries in the Himalayas
---

As I am about to turn ‘x’-year old where ‘x’ is a very special number for me, I thought of celebrating this with a summary of everything that I learnt in life especially during my life’s most happening phase. My BTech college was in the Himalayan valley, Srinagar, Garhwal, Uttarakhand. Those years of wandering in the Himalayas is what I call the most happening phase of my life. 

Following is the summary of my realizations/learnings/(re)discoveries which are purely based on my personal experiences & are likely to be updated with time:

### Love:)
1. **What is love?** Responsibility of doing all that I can for that thing/that person whom I love. This also, by definition, rules out the possibility of feeling jealous when someone else seems to love that thing/that person more than I do. This is because I have limited energy & if I  get someone else also to share this responsibility, that’s something to be welcomed. 
Eg. I know that I am a Maths lover(I always say "who am I, if not a Maths lover?"). If I contribute something in/related to this field, that will bring immense joy to me. But even if someone else contributes, I will firstly be happy that this field is progressing & there are people to love this, even when I am not there. Secondly, I’ll analyze that person’s contribution & will try to learn how I could also have done something similar as part of my responsibility(love). Similary, if I love a person, apart from my responsibilities towards that person, I will also try that I make others fall in love with that person so that even when I am not there, there is someone to take care of him/her.
2. **What is unconditional love?** Love has to be unconditional. Conditional one is called Business!
3. **So who loves me the most in this physical world?** My organs! They have stayed with me forever, they work for me silently every moment even when I forget them. Most likely, they won’t even show me their ‘face’ in my entire lifetime.
4. **How do I know if I love something or someone?** Someone or something that makes me forget everything else is what I love.
5. **What is detachment?** I realized this after studying ER diagrams in the DBMS course. If there is someone/something that I love, I shouldn’t get into the illusion that I am owned by that person/thing or that I own that person/thing. I am a separate ‘entity’ E1, that person/thing is a separate ‘entity’ E2, I am associated with it only through a relation ‘R’. 
Attachment is an invisible poison that can turn love into business. How much ever I love something, I only have to focus on my responsibilities as part of the relation ‘R’; I have to finish my part & leave!

### God:)
6. **Who/What is God?** There is definitely some power that created everything & which also drives magical transformations in & around me every moment. I call that power as God.
7. **We can pray anywhere then why do we go to temples?** This question was answered to me by another question: I can study anywhere, then why do I go to the library?
8. **How can I worship God?** Serving what God created- people around me, things around me & me.
9. **Should I also serve bad people?** People whom I might think as ‘bad’ are just ignorant of a few things; just like I am ignorant of a few other things.

### Work:)
10. Before starting any work, I need to be very **clear & conviced why I want to do it**. This first requires a bit of exploration of that work. (Failing to do this was the main reason I couldn’t crack JEE Advanced.)
11. Once convinced about doing that work, I need to figure out **what is the objective to optimize for**. (Failing to do this was the main reason I couldn’t score well in the GATE exam.)
12. **Is there a universal objective that applies to everything?** Yes- Loyalty to the resources that I am blessed with.
13. **How not to get frustrated with failures?** (i) &/or (ii):
   >i. Do things that you love. Where there is love, there is no expectation which implies no frustration.<br>
   >ii. Recall that frustration makes things look worse than they actually are. Target is not learning in 1 epoch. Target is to get the closest estimate of the exact gradient to backpropagate at every epoch. 
14. **How to get the closest estimate of the exact gradient?** By focusing every moment.
15. **What is focus?** focus= (i) && (ii)
   >i. When doing task A, if a thought about task B comes, first ask whether it is ‘that’ important. If not, then simply note task B & continue with task A.<br>
   >ii.While doing task A, not wasting energy in thinking whether it will be done. I have limited energy, so let me give it all to the process.

### Coping hacks:)
16. I can never be lonely, I just have to feel my **Breath** which is my companion forever, something that keeps me entertained every moment. I learnt a very handy thing during an Art of Living workshop organized by my BTech college during my final week as a BTech. It is that all of us know that our emotions can change the course of our breath but the reverse is also true. So, when I experience unsolicited emotions, I just breathe normally & it becomes fine.
17. **Even if I am feeling bad, it need not mean something bad is happening to me** It could just be another tantrum thrown by my mind. A coping hack- sleep!
18. **Only worry about things that you can control** Such an obvious thing, yet, it took me 21 years to accept this.
19. **Every phase, however traumatizing it may seem, comes to an end** Learnt during the 5hrs Rishikesh-Srinagar bus journeys that were nothing less than a torture to me, especially during my initial BTech days.
20. **There is nothing good/bad; keep no prejudices, just stillness with awareness** Learned this when all my notions were shattered in 2018 & I simply surrendered to the universe.
